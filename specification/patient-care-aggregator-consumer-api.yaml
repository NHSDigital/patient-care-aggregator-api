    ## Overview
    
    ![Patient Care Aggregator FHIR API context diagram](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/developer/api-catalogue/patient-care-aggregator-fhir-api/patient-care-aggregator-api-context-diagram.svg?raw=true)
    
    Use this API to get an aggregated list of referrals and bookings for a patient from secondary care providers.
    
    The API aggregates details of referrals and bookings from a number of systems. For details, see [status and roadmap](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/referrals-and-bookings/patient-care-aggregator#status-and-roadmap).
    
    We might add other providers in the future.
    
    This API is only for use in patient-facing applications, not point-of-care applications.
    
    For more details, see [Patient access to referrals and bookings via the Patient Care Aggregator](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/referrals-and-bookings/patient-care-aggregator).
    
    ## Who can use this API
    Currently, this API is for internal use only - the only API consumer is the NHS App.
    
    If you are interested in using this API in another context, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ## API status
    This API is [in production, beta but internal](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning the API is not currently available for integration by external third parties. If you want to use it, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) and we'll look at making it available.
        
    If you would still like to be involved in our beta programme or use this API, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
        
    ## Service level
    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year but only supported during working hours.
    
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
    
    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).
    
    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)
    global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/),
    except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.
    
    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which have been built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core).
    
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/CarePlan` not `/care-plans`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for FHIR bundle entries
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    
    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    You must adhere to the following requirements when integrating to the Wayfinder Patient Care Aggregator.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.
    
    The end user must be:
    * a patient who receives health and social care or makes use of NHS services
    * strongly authenticated, using [NHS login](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login)
    
    To use this API, use one of the following security patterns:

    ### Sandbox testing
    This API does not currently have a sandbox environment. If you would like us to add one, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation
    
    It is an end-to-end environment - it includes instances of each of the upstream applications, and is linked to the Integration (AOS) instance of NHS login.
    
    For details of test data, see [Patient care aggregator test data packs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/patient-care-aggregator-fhir/patient-care-aggregator-fhir-api-test-data).
    
    For more details on integration testing, see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
    
    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.
    
    To onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process) process.
    
    To get started with the SCAL process for this API, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
    
    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.
