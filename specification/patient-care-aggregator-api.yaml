    ## Overview
    
    ![Patient Care Aggregator FHIR API context diagram](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/developer/api-catalogue/patient-care-aggregator-fhir-api/patient-care-aggregator-api-context-diagram.svg?raw=true)
    
    Use this API to get an aggregated list of referrals and bookings for a patient from secondary care providers.
    
    The API aggregates details of referrals and bookings from the following systems:
    - [NHS e-Referral Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service) (referrals and bookings)
    - [DrDoctor](https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/) (bookings only)
    - [Patients Know Best](https://patientsknowbest.com/) (bookings only)
    
    Other providers may be added in the future.
    
    This API is only for use in patient-facing applications, not point-of-care applications.
    
    ## Who can use this API
    Currently, this API is for internal use only - the only API consumer is the NHS App.
    
    If you are interested in using this API in another context, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it's available for testing
    - it's not available in production
    - we might make breaking changes
    
    ## Service level
    The [service level](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels) for this API
    will be confirmed once it moves into production. It is likely to be gold.
    
    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)
    global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/),
    except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which have built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core),
    specifically [UK.core.r4 1.0.0](https://simplifier.net/packages/uk.core.r4/1.0.0).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/CarePlan` not `/care-plans`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for FHIR bundle entries
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    This access mode is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.
    
    The end user must be:
    * a patient who receives health and social care or makes use of NHS services
    * strongly authenticated, using [NHS login](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login)
     
    To use this access mode, use one of the following security patterns:

    ### Sandbox testing
    This API does not currently have a sandbox environment.
    
    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation

    It is an end-to-end environment - it includes instances of each of the back-end applications, and is linked to the Integration (AOS) instance of NHS login.
    
    For details of test data, see [Patient care aggregator test data packs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/patient-care-aggregator-fhir/patient-care-aggregator-fhir-api-test-data).

    For more details on integration testing, see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
    
    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so itâ€™s worth planning well ahead.
    
    To onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process) process.

      description: |
        Use this endpoint to get an aggregated list of referrals and bookings for a given patient from secondary care providers.
        The endpoint checks for referrals and bookings from multiple back-end applications and aggregates them into a single list.
        
        The endpoint returns the list as a FHIR 'bundle' which includes:
        - one `CarePlan` resource, including all referrals and bookings found for the patient, but only if any referrals or bookings were found
        - one `OperationOutcome` resource, if any of the back-end applications returned an error
        
        If no referrals or bookings were found for the patient,
        and there were no errors, the endpoint returns an empty FHIR bundle.

# TBC feels like the error codes should be more specific e.g. UNDER_16_DENIED would be better as an error code, not a diagnostic code
# TBC is the input parameter an ID token or an OAuth 2.0 access token?
# TBC invalid NHS number includes the NHS number in the diagnostics - might be better not to include it
# TBC error code format for 401 errors - PDS spec says ACCESS_DENIED
# TBC Des says this is a restriction of FHIR - Daniel Lynagh has a code set
