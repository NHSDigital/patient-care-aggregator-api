  title: "Patient Care Aggregator API"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to get an aggregated list of referrals and bookings at secondary care providers.
    
    The API aggregates details of referrals and bookings from the following systems:
    - e-Referrals Service (referrals and bookings)
    - DrDoctor (bookings only)
    - Patient Knows Best (bookings only)
    
    Other providers may be added in the future.
    
    This API is only for use in patient-facing applications, not in point-of-care applications.
    
    ## Who can use this API
    Currently, this API is for internal use only - the only API consumer is the NHS App.
    
    If you are interested in using this API, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it's available for testing
    - it's not available in production
    - we might make breaking changes
    
    ## Service level
    The [service level](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels) for this API will be confirmed once it moves into production.
    
    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to:
    - [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir), a global standard for health care data exchange
    - [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core) for UK-specific extensions to FHIR

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/CarePlan` not `/care-plans`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for FHIR bundle entries
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    This access mode is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.
    
    The end user must be:
    * a patient who receives health and social care or makes use of NHS services
    * strongly authenticated, using [NHS login](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login)
     
    To use this access mode, use one of the following security patterns:

    TBC confirm the URLs are correct including the FHIR/R4 bit
    TBC URL shouldn't have "-api" as a suffix

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation
    
    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    
    TBC is there actually a sandbox?
    TBC do we provide sandbox scenarios?

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation

    TBC what test data do we have in place?
    TBC what back-ends is it connected to?
    TBC does it require co-ordination?

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
    
    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so itâ€™s worth planning well ahead.
    
    To onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process) process.
    
    To get started with the SCAL process for this API, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)
